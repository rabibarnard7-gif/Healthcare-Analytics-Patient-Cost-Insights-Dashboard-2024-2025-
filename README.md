📊 8. Dashboard KPIs

👥 Total Patients: 2327

🏥 Hospitalisation Count: 1573

💵 Total Healthcare Cost: ₹3,12,36,633.49

💳 Average Cost per Patient: ₹13,423.56

🔎 9. Visual Insights
🍃 9.1 Cancer Status: Smoker vs Non-Smoker

🚬 Smokers: 405

🚭 Non-Smokers: 1922
Smoking significantly increases long-term medical risk.

⚖️ 9.2 Charges by Weight Status

🟥 Obese → Highest cost

🟧 Overweight → Moderate

🟦 Normal → Lower

🟩 Underweight → Lowest
Obesity is the strongest cost amplifier.

🩸 9.3 HBA1C Cost Analysis

🩺 Diabetic → Highest

🔸 Prediabetic → Moderate

🔹 Normal → Lowest
Strong correlation between diabetes severity & cost.

🏥 9.4 Hospital Tier-wise Cost & Severity

🟦 Tier-2 → Highest charges & severity

🟨 Tier-1 → Moderate

🟩 Tier-3 → Lowest
Tier-2 is the system's core high-complexity center.

🎛️ 9.5 Dashboard Slicers

⚖ Weight Status

🩸 Diabetes Status

🏥 Hospital Tier

👤 Patient Name

Interactive exploration for deep insights.

💡 10. Strategic Insights
📊 Descriptive

Majority are non-smokers

Obesity drives up healthcare costs

Diabetes severity increases annual expenses

Tier-2 hospitals carry higher complexity

🔍 Diagnostic

⚠ Obesity & diabetes = major cost drivers

⚠ Smokers carry higher cancer risk burden

⚠ Tier-2 shows operational pressure

🔮 Predictive

📈 Diabetes & obesity costs expected to rise

🏥 Tier-2 load will remain high

📉 Early prevention reduces future costs

📝 Prescriptive

🚑 Improve preventive health programs

🩺 Promote smoking cessation

🏥 Increase Tier-2 hospital support

💳 Implement risk-based insurance pricing

🔚 11. Conclusion

✔ Developed a comprehensive Excel Healthcare Dashboard
